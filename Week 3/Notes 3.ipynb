    "## Example 1: Optimizing City Grid Layout with Local Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Local search algorithms, like hill climbing, offer approaches for solving optimization problems by iteratively searching for better solutions in the neighborhood of the current state. They are often useful for dealing with situations in which due to vastness of the state space, it's impossible to navigate all the options to conclusively say which option is the best. This example uses a hill climbing local search algorithm to optimize the layout of a city grid, focusing on the strategic placement of hospitals to serve houses efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a city grid with specified dimensions, the objective is to place a predetermined number of hospitals in a way that minimizes the total distance between houses and their nearest hospital. This problem involves generating an initial random layout of houses within the grid and then iteratively relocating hospitals to improve the overall \"cost\" - the summed distance from each house to its closest hospital.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- The city grid is randomly populated with houses, and an initial set of hospitals is placed.\n",
    "- The hill climbing algorithm seeks to minimize the total cost by exploring neighboring states - different hospital placements - and choosing the move that results in the lowest cost.\n",
    "- An optional random restart mechanism can be employed to improve the solution by avoiding local minima traps.\n"

    "- **Library Use:** Code 2 employs the `constraint` library, simplifying the problem setup and solving process.\n",
    "- **Problem Setup:** Direct addition of variables and constraints using library functions, eliminating the need for custom functions to check consistency and select unassigned variables.\n",
    "- **Constraint Definition:** Constraints are added using `addConstraint` with a lambda function, streamlining the process.\n",
    "- **Solution Process:** The library's built-in method is used to find all solutions, removing the need for explicit backtracking logic.\n"
