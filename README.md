## KIU_Artificial_Intelligence_Course
Senior Year Computer Science Course For Artificial Intelligence at KIU

The idea behind the course is to Start from the classical AI and slowly progress to more modern implementations of AI in modern software, such as GPT models. 

##Syllabus 
#0. Search
This week introduces the fundamental concept of search problems in artificial intelligence, exploring how an agent moves from an initial state to a goal state. Using real-world examples like navigation apps, puzzles, and mazes, we delve into various components of search algorithms and their practical applications.

#1. Knowledge
This Week delves into the concept of knowledge in AI, focusing on how AI systems can represent knowledge and make logical inferences based on it. Using a blend of theoretical and practical examples, we explore the foundations of knowledge-based agents and the principles of propositional logic, the foundation of which is simple boolean arithmetic and inference rules. 
#2. Uncertainty   
This week, discusses crucial aspect of uncertainty in AI decision-making. Unlike the previous week, where the focus was on definite knowledge, here we explore scenarios where AI must operate with incomplete or uncertain information. This week is pivotal in understanding how AI can make informed decisions in real-world situations where certainty is a luxury, such as weather prediction or medical diagnoses. 
#3. Optimizitation 
This week, explores how to select the best option from a set of available choices. Unlike searching for a single solution or making decisions under uncertainty, optimization involves finding the most efficient or effective solution among many. This week covers various optimization strategies and their applications in AI, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of how to approach and solve complex optimization problems
#4. Machine Learning 
This week, delves into the realm of Machine Learning (ML), a pivotal area in AI that enables computers to learn from data rather than through explicit programming. This week covers different types of ML methods, primarily focusing on supervised and unsupervised learning, and their applications. The lectures introduce fundamental ML concepts, algorithms, and their implications in solving real-world problems.
#5. Neural Networks 
This week's focus is on understanding the structure, function, and application of artificial neural networks in AI, exploring various types of networks and their specific uses.
#6. Natural Language Processing 
This week introduces Natural Language Processing (NLP), a critical domain in AI focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. It covers various NLP tasks and delves into the intricacies of language processing, including syntax, semantics, and advanced NLP models and techniques.
