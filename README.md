| Name       | Week | Description      |
|------------|-----|-----------------|
| Search | 0  | This week introduces the fundamental concept of search problems in artificial intelligence, exploring how an agent moves from an initial state to a goal state. Using real-world examples like navigation apps, puzzles, and mazes, we delve into various components of search algorithms and their practical applications. |
| Knowledge   | 1  | This Week delves into the concept of knowledge in AI, focusing on how AI systems can represent knowledge and make logical inferences based on it. Using a blend of theoretical and practical examples, we explore the foundations of knowledge-based agents and the principles of propositional logic, the foundation of which is simple boolean arithmetic and inference rules. |
| Uncertainty | 2  | This week, we discuss the crucial aspect of uncertainty in AI decision-making. Unlike the previous week, where the focus was on definite knowledge, here we explore scenarios where AI must operate with incomplete or uncertain information. This week is pivotal in understanding how AI can make informed decisions in real-world situations where certainty is a luxury, such as weather prediction or medical diagnoses.      |
| Optimizitation | 3  | This week, explores how to select the best option from a set of available choices. Unlike searching for a single solution or making decisions under uncertainty, optimization involves finding the most efficient or effective solution among many. This week covers various optimization strategies and their applications in AI, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of how to approach and solve complex optimization problems |
| Machine Learning | 4  | This week, delves into the realm of Machine Learning (ML), a pivotal area in AI that enables computers to learn from data rather than through explicit programming. This week covers different types of ML methods, primarily focusing on supervised and unsupervised learning, and their applications. The lectures introduce fundamental ML concepts, algorithms, and their implications in solving real-world problems |
| Neural Networks  | 5  | This week's focus is on understanding the structure, function, and application of artificial neural networks in AI, exploring various types of networks and their specific uses |
| Natural Language Processing | 6  | This week introduces Natural Language Processing (NLP), a critical domain in AI focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human language. It covers various NLP tasks and delves into the intricacies of language processing, including syntax, semantics, and advanced NLP models and techniques |
| Neural Networks & Backpropagation | 7  | This week provides a lower level introduction to neural networks and backpropagation, centered around building 'micrograd'. It covers the basics of neural network architecture and the backpropagation algorithm, essential for understanding how AI learns from data.|
| Makemore Part 1: basics | 8 | Focusing on the basics of language modeling, this week delves into the construction of 'makemore', a simple language model. It explores how AI can generate text and the fundamental principles behind these models. |
| Makemore Part 2: MLP | 9 | Continuing with the 'makemore' series, this week focuses on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Students will learn about the structure and function of MLPs in deep learning and their role in improving language models. |
| Makemore Part 3: Advanced Techniques | 10 | This week covers advanced concepts in neural networks, including different types of activations, gradient methods, and Batch Normalization. These concepts are crucial for enhancing the performance and stability of neural networks. |
| Makemore Part 4: Mastering Backpropagation | 11 | Diving deeper into backpropagation, this week aims to turn students into 'Backprop Ninjas'. It emphasizes understanding and implementing efficient backpropagation techniques in neural networks. |
| Makemore Part 5: WaveNet | 12 | This week introduces WaveNet, a deep neural network for generating audio. Students will explore its architecture and learn how it's used for tasks like speech synthesis, contributing to their understanding of diverse AI applications. |
| Building GPT | 13 | The week is dedicated to building a GPT model from scratch. It involves a hands-on approach to understanding the architecture, training process, and applications of GPT models in natural language processing. |
| Future of ML and Final Project | 14 | This week aims to prepare students for independent research within the field, beginning with key research papers that have shaped the field. It then explores pioneering companies in machine learning, illustrating real-world applications. One of the examples discussed, is an introduction to the MAMBA model, discussing its role in addressing Transformer architecture limitations and its future AI impact. This session aims to enrich students' understanding of machine learning's current landscape and emerging trends. At the end of the lecture, Students will be given guidelines, in order to begin work on their final projects in small groups. |
| Final Project, cont. | 15 | This week will be dedicated to refining the, final projects. Presentations of which be on the final exam date |
