   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "To predict the next token accurately, it's very useful if each token considers the context provided by all its predecessors. The self-attention mechanism facilitates this by allowing each token to interact directly with every previous token. One straightforward method to implement this is by averaging the embeddings of prior tokens. This approach simplifies the communication between tokens but comes with a tradeoff—it can lead to a loss of detailed spatial information, as the specific positions of tokens within the sequence are not clear. This method is effective for capturing general context, but it will overlook the exact order of tokens, leading to suboptimal performance."

By removing the vocab_size parameter from the constructor and defining it globally, we streamline the model's interface. The embedding layer will be adjusted to output a size of n_embed rather than the fixed vocabulary size. To connect these embeddings to our desired output dimension, a linear layer that outputs to the vocab_size will have to be added. This structure aims to enhances the model's ability to learn more nuanced features from the data while maintaining direct compatibility with the vocabulary size through the final output layer."

    "\n",
    "- **Mechanism Overview**:\n",
    "  - Self-attention acts as a mechanism where nodes (tokens) in a directed graph observe and aggregate information from each other.\n",
    "  - It aggregates this information as a weighted sum, with weights determined by the data-dependent relevance of each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spatial Independence**:\n",
    "  - Self-attention processes a set of vectors without inherent spatial relationships, hence the necessity for positional encoding to provide context about the sequence order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch Processing**:\n",
    "  - Each example within a batch is processed independently, ensuring no cross-communication between different sequence examples in the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encoder vs. Decoder Attention Blocks**:\n",
    "  - **Encoder Attention**: Allows all tokens to interact freely; commonly used in applications like translation and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "  - **Decoder Attention**: Uses triangular masking to restrict attention flow, ensuring that each token can only attend to previous tokens (autoregressive property). This is typical in tasks like language modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Self-Attention vs. Cross-Attention**:\n",
    "  - **Self-Attention**: Both keys and values are derived from the same input as the queries.\n",

    "  - Involves scaling the attention weights (`wei`) by the square root of the dimensionality of the key vectors to maintain unit variance. This prevents softmax from becoming too peaky at initialization, ensuring a more uniform distribution of attention weights and avoiding extreme focus on a single vector unless warranted by high relevance.\n",
