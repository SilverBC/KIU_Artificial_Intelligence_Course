    "* State space -> set of all reachable configuations of the world\n",
    "* Goal Test -> condition for determining if the goal is reached or not\n",
    "* Path Cost -> numerical cost, usually sum of cost of each action taken to get from start to end. \n",

In adversarial search our algorithm tries to face an opponent trying to achieve the opposite goal. Table top games, such as chess, tic tac toe and checkers can all be considered a form of adversarial search. A common method for dealing with this problem is the application of the Min-Max algorithm, where the agent assumes that it's opponent makes optimal moves, while the enemy also assumes that the agent is making optimal moves.... this goes on until resolution. \n",
