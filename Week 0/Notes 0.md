## This week covers classical Artificial Intelligence through Search Algorithms and heuristics 
1) Terminology in Search problems, 
    * Agents 
    * State Actions
    * Transition model
    * State space
    * Goal Test
    * Path Cost
    * Solution 
2) Search Problem Algorithms 
    * Depth-first Search 
    * Breadth-first Search 
    * Greedy Best-First Search 
    * A* Search 
    * Adversarial Search 
3) Implementation of Adversarial Search with Min-Max, Alpha-Beta pruning and depth limitation.
