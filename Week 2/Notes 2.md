## This week covers how artificial intelligence deals with uncertainty and probabilities. 

1) Axioms of Probability 
    * 0 < P < 1
    * Sum(P(omega) = 1)
    * Random Variable: some x, that can take some set of values {a, b, c} in probabilistic manner. 
    * Unconditional probability: % chance in absence of any other evidence
    * Conditional probaility: % chance given some evidence b

        $$ P(a \mid b) = \frac{P(a \cap b)}{P(b)} $$


$$\begin{array}{c}
\alpha \rightarrow \beta \\
\alpha \\
\hline
\beta
\end{array} $$
