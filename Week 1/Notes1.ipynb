    "### Resolution Refutation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Resolution Refutation is a potent method used in logic and artificial intelligence to determine if a knowledge base (KB) entails a specific conclusion, denoted as 'X'. The process involves transforming the KB into its Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and then systematically attempting to produce an empty clause. Achieving an empty clause signifies that the knowledge base indeed entails 'X'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **disjunction**: propositions connected with an Or logical connectives (P ∨ Q ∨ R)\n",
    "- **conjunction**: propositions connected with an And logical connectives (P ∧ Q ∧ R).\n",
    "- **Clause**: A disjunction (OR) of literals, where a literal is either a propositional symbol or its negation. A clause could be a single literal (P) or a combination of several literals connected by OR (P ∨ ¬Q ∨ R).\n",
    "- **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)**: conjunction (AND) of clauses, for example: (A ∨ B ∨ C) ∧ (D ∨ ¬E) ∧ (F ∨ G)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conversion to CNF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Eliminate Biconditionals**: Transform (α ↔ β) into (α → β) ∧ (β → α).\n",
    "2. **Eliminate Implications**: Convert (α → β) into ¬α ∨ β.\n",
    "3. **Move Negation Inwards**: Apply De Morgan’s Laws to ensure negations only apply to literals.\n",
    "4. **Apply Distributive Law**: To distribute OR over AND, making the expression suitable for resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resolution Refutation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Factoring**: Remove duplicate literals within clauses to simplify the expressions.\n",
    "- **Resolving Literals**: The process where a literal and its negation, when resolved, produce the empty clause (), indicating a contradiction.\n",
    "- **Empty Clause**: The goal of resolution refutation, symbolizing that the KB cannot simultaneously be true and false, thus proving entailment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proving Entailment\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove if KB entails 'X':\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contradiction Check**: Add ¬'X' to KB, convert to CNF, and seek to produce an empty clause through resolution.\n",
    "2. **Derive Empty Clause**: The derivation of the empty clause confirms that KB entails 'X'.\n",
    "3. **Failure to Derive Empty Clause**: Indicates no entailment between KB and 'X'.\n"
